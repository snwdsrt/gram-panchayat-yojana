    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The 15th Finance Commission has provided significant financial support to Panchayats and Rural Local Bodies (RLBs) for essential infrastructure and services related to water supply, sanitation, roads, and drainage. These services are vital for improving the quality of life, public health, and socio-economic conditions in rural India. A total of Rs. 1.42 Lakh Crore has been allocated for water and sanitation services for the years 2021-22 to 2025-26, with a focus on ensuring tap water supply and improved sanitation in rural areas.</p>

    <h2>Financial Allocation and Utilization</h2>
    <p>The 15th Finance Commission has allocated Rs. 1.42 Lakh Crore as a tied grant for water supply and sanitation services over a five-year period (2021-22 to 2025-26). The funds will be directed to Gram Panchayats, enabling them to act as local public utilities responsible for the delivery and management of water and sanitation services in their respective areas.</p>
    <p>The total amount allocated for the period is Rs. 2,36,805 Crore, with 60% (Rs. 1,42,084 Crore) earmarked specifically for water and sanitation activities.

    <h2>Jal Jeevan Mission: Ensuring Tap Water Supply</h2>
    <img src="../assets/images/water_distribution.jpg">
    <p>As part of the government’s commitment to providing assured potable tap water to every household in rural India, the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) was launched in 2019. The mission aims to provide a regular and long-term water supply to every rural home. This initiative, with an outlay of Rs. 3.60 Lakh Crore, focuses on ensuring ‘no one is left out’ and will transform the lives of rural households by making drinking water available at an affordable service delivery charge.</p>
    <p>With more than Rs. 1 Lakh Crore allocated under the 15th Finance Commission for water supply and sanitation activities, this will have a significant impact on the rural economy, public health, and quality of life.</p>

    <h2>Sanitation and Open Defecation Free (ODF) Status</h2>
    <img src="../assets/images/solidliquidwastemanagement.jpg">
    <p>One of the key aspects of rural development is the improvement of sanitation. Under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) Phase-II, the government aims to achieve ODF Plus status in villages. This involves not only maintaining ODF status but also ensuring effective Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM), plastic-free villages, and sustainable sanitation practices.</p>
    <p>The 15th Finance Commission tied grants will support the continuation of efforts to maintain ODF status, improve sanitation facilities, and ensure that rural areas adopt comprehensive waste management strategies. These measures are critical to reducing water-borne diseases and improving the overall health and well-being of rural populations.</p>

    <h2>Technical Assistance and Capacity Building</h2>

    <p>To enable Panchayats and Rural Local Bodies (RLBs) to effectively utilize the 15th Finance Commission grants, the government will provide technical assistance. The Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti, will assist Panchayats with planning, execution, and maintenance of water supply and sanitation systems. In addition, state departments such as Water & Sanitation, Rural Water Supply, and Public Health Engineering will offer further support to these local bodies.</p>
    <p>The Ministry of Jal Shakti has also developed a manual for the utilization of the funds, which has been distributed to all state governments. The aim is to translate the manual into regional languages and make it available at the village level. Additionally, training programs and sensitization campaigns will be launched to empower local bodies to manage and maintain these services efficiently.</p>

    <h2>Operation and Maintenance of Water and Sanitation Facilities</h2>
    <img src="../assets/images/drainage_facility.jpg">
    <p>Ensuring the sustainability of water supply schemes and sanitation facilities is essential for their long-term success. Gram Panchayats, or their sub-committees, such as the Village Water & Sanitation Committee (VWSC), are tasked with managing the operation and maintenance of these services. The government stresses the importance of implementing a robust ‘operation and maintenance’ policy in states, with the aim of recovering service charges to cover the recurring costs of water and sanitation services.</p>
    <p>This policy will ensure that the facilities remain operational for at least 30 years, providing uninterrupted services to rural communities and contributing to the health and economic development of rural India.</p>

    <h2>Village Action Plans and Gram Panchayat Development Plans</h2>
    <p>As part of the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations, every village is encouraged to develop a 5-year Village Action Plan that aligns with the finance commission’s period. These action plans will focus on critical components such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strengthening drinking water sources</li>
        <li>Providing water supply and improving infrastructure</li>
        <li>Greywater management and reuse</li>
        <li>Solid and Liquid Waste Management</li>
        <li>Operation and maintenance of facilities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These Village Action Plans will be an integral part of Gram Panchayat Development Plans, ensuring that local bodies are actively involved in improving water and sanitation services and achieving long-term sustainability.</p>

    <h2>Impact of the 15th Finance Commission’s Tied Grants</h2>
    <p>The 15th Finance Commission’s allocation for water and sanitation will lead to the following outcomes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved public health by reducing water-borne diseases</li>
        <li>Improved socio-economic conditions through enhanced access to clean drinking water and sanitation</li>
        <li>Reduced school dropouts due to improved sanitation facilities</li>
        <li>Reduction of drudgery, especially for women, in accessing clean water</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These grants will also contribute to the overall development of rural areas, empowering local communities to take responsibility for their own development and creating a model of self-reliance.</p>
