    <h1>Providing 9 and 11 Certificate, Change of Account for Land Converted Land</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Forms 9 and 11 are crucial documents required for property tax collection by Gram Panchayats in Karnataka. These forms facilitate land transactions, resolve disputes, and ensure compliance with local tax regulations. Additionally, they help in registering non-agricultural properties within Gram Panchayat areas. Let's understand what Form 9 and Form 11 mean and how they play an essential role in the land conversion and property registration process in Karnataka.</p>

    <h2>What is Form 9?</h2>
    <p>Form 9, also known as Khata A, is issued by Gram Panchayats for non-agricultural properties within their jurisdiction. The implementation of Form 9 is governed by the Karnataka Panchayat Raj (Gram Panchayat Budgeting and Accounting) Rules, 2006, under Rule 28 and its Amendment Rules in 2013. Here’s what you need to know about Form 9:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The property must undergo an official transformation and be designated as a non-agricultural property under the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964.</li>
        <li>The property should have approved plans sanctioned under the Town and Country Planning Act by the relevant government department.</li>
        <li>The property must receive land certification from the Tahsildar, and its location within the Gramthana (village) must be accurately outlined.</li>
        <li>If the property is part of a government housing scheme (such as Basava, Ambedkar, or Indira Awaas Yojana), it must be allocated to the beneficiaries of the scheme.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is Form 11?</h2>
    <p>Form 11 is issued by Gram Panchayats for non-agricultural properties within their jurisdiction. It is regulated by the Karnataka Panchayat Raj (Grama Panchayat Budgeting and Accounting) Rules, 2006, under Rule 30 and its Amendment Rules in 2013. Here’s what you need to know about Form 11:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Form 11 serves as a certificate for properties that are not part of the agricultural category, certifying their conversion to non-agricultural use.</li>
        <li>The procedure for obtaining Form 11 is similar to that of Form 9 and involves following legal guidelines under the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Obtain Form 9 and Form 11?</h2>
    <p>The Gram Panchayat office issues both Form 9 and Form 11, with the Panchayat Development Officer and the Gram Panchayat Secretary facilitating the process. The application process for these forms is handled via e-SWATHU, a workflow-based software system. Here’s the process to follow:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Submit a request for Form 9 or Form 11 through the e-SWATHU system.</li>
        <li>Upon successful application, the forms are issued within three days of payment of the prescribed fee.</li>
        <li>The forms are available for non-agricultural properties after the verification and official transformation process is complete.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Difference Between Panchayat Khata and e-Khata</h2>
    <p>When dealing with 9/11 Khata plots, it's important to understand the difference between a Panchayat Khata and an e-Khata. These terms help to differentiate between traditional and online records, ensuring a clearer and more modern approach to property registration.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Panchayat Khata:</strong> This refers to the manual record of properties maintained by Gram Panchayats. It is usually issued for properties that are not converted into urban land and are still under the traditional panchayat jurisdiction.</li>
        <li><strong>e-Khata:</strong> This is the electronic record of property transactions maintained by municipal authorities. It is a digital record and is often used for properties in urban areas or converted lands.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Change of Account for Land Converted Land</h2>
    <p>If the land is converted from agricultural to non-agricultural use, a change of account is required. The property owner must obtain a certificate from the Gram Panchayat that the land is now registered as non-agricultural and has been included in the records accordingly. This involves the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Obtain a conversion certificate from the relevant authorities.</li>
        <li>Ensure the land is properly registered as non-agricultural in the local records.</li>
        <li>Submit the necessary application and documents to the Gram Panchayat to update the records and change the account status for the property.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Form 9 and Form 11 are essential for the registration of non-agricultural properties in Karnataka. They help in property tax collection, land transactions, and ensuring compliance with local laws. By obtaining these forms, landowners can ensure that their properties are legally recognized and compliant with the Gram Panchayat regulations. Furthermore, understanding the distinction between Panchayat Khata and e-Khata is crucial for property owners and potential buyers in Karnataka's real estate market.</p>
