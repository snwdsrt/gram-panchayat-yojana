    <h1>Pragati Colony Scheme</h1>
    <p>The Pragati Colony Scheme is an initiative by the Karnataka Social Welfare Department aimed at the comprehensive development of colonies predominantly inhabited by Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). Launched in 2018, the scheme focuses on providing essential infrastructure to improve the quality of life in these communities.</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhance the living standards of SC/ST communities.</li>
        <li>Provide basic infrastructure facilities such as drinking water, roads, electricity, and drainage systems.</li>
        <li>Ensure holistic development of selected colonies with significant SC/ST populations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Financial Allocation</h2>
    <p>In November 2018, the Karnataka government sanctioned â‚¹202.5 crore under the SC/ST sub-scheme for the development of these colonies across 123 assembly constituencies. This fund is allocated to ensure the timely execution of infrastructure projects in the identified areas.</p>

    <h2>Implementation Strategy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Deputy Commissioners (DCs) are responsible for identifying colonies with more than 50% SC/ST population in their respective districts.</li>
        <li>DCs collaborate with local Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) to prioritize and plan infrastructure projects.</li>
        <li>The focus is on immediate commencement of works related to drinking water, roads, electricity, drainage, and connecting roads.</li>
        <li>Construction and development activities are undertaken by the Public Works Department and Zilla Panchayat construction departments, adhering to Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements (KTTP) rules and regulations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Monitoring and Accountability</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>DCs serve as the Presidents of the District Monitoring Committees, overseeing the progress and quality of the projects.</li>
        <li>Regular reports detailing the utilization of funds and project statuses are submitted to the government.</li>
        <li>Officials are held accountable for any delays or deviations in the implementation of the scheme.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved access to basic amenities for SC/ST communities.</li>
        <li>Enhanced connectivity and infrastructure within the colonies.</li>
        <li>Overall socio-economic development leading to better living conditions.</li>
    </ul>
