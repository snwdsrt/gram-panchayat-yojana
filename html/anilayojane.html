    <p>Anila Yojane, also known as the National Biogas and Organic Manure Programme (NNBOMP), is a centrally sponsored scheme implemented by the Government of India since 1982-83. The program aims to promote the use of biogas as a clean, non-polluting, smoke and soot-free fuel produced from cattle dung, human waste, and organic matter through anaerobic digestion. The resultant slurry from the biogas plant serves as high-quality manure for agricultural fields. This initiative is primarily targeted towards women, aiming to provide them with sustainable energy solutions and improve their quality of life.</p>
