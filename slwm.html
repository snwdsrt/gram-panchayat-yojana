	<h1>Solid and Liquid Waste Management in Rural Areas</h1>
	<p>
		Water, sanitation, and hygiene directly impact human health and have far reaching consequences when ignored. India is one of the fastest developing economies, but when it
		comes to WASH indicators, it continues to lag behind. With a population of over 1.2 billion, there is a mounting and urgent need to address sanitation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Solid and Liquid Waste Management is one of the key components of Swachh Bharat Mission, launched with the objective of bringing improvement in cleanliness, hygiene and
		the general quality of life in rural areas.
	</p>
	<p>
		It focuses on Solid Liquid Waste Management in rural areas along with Open Defecation Free activities.
