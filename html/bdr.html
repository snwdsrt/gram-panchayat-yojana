        <li><strong>Rural Areas:</strong> Births, deaths, and stillbirths occurring in rural areas are registered by Village Accountants through Nada Kacheri at the Hobli level. This ensures that rural residents have easy access to registration services.</li>
        <li><strong>Government Health Institutions:</strong> Births, deaths, and stillbirths that occur in government health institutions are registered in eJanMa by the concerned Medical Officer.

        <li><strong>Urban Local Bodies and BBMP Areas:</strong> In urban areas, including the BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) area, births, deaths, and stillbirths are registered by Health Officers and Health Inspectors in their respective jurisdictions, ensuring the proper documentation of these events.</li>
        <li><strong>Private Hospitals:</strong> For births or deaths occurring in private hospitals, the respective private hospital reports the event to the concerned Registrar for inclusion in the official records.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Inclusion of Name of Child in Birth Certificate</h2>
    <p>For parents who wish to include their child's name in the birth certificate, they must contact the respective Registrar or Sub-Registrar. The authorities involved in this process include:</p>
