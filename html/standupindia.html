    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>The Stand Up India Scheme caters to promoting entrepreneurship among women, SC, and ST categories—sections of the population facing significant hurdles due to lack of advice/mentorship and inadequate and delayed credit. The scheme intends to leverage the institutional credit structure to reach out to these underserved sectors of the population in starting greenfield enterprises. It caters to both ready and trainee borrowers. To extend collateral-free coverage, the Government of India has set up the Credit Guarantee Fund for Stand Up India (CGFSI). Apart from providing credit facilities, the scheme also envisages extending handholding support to potential borrowers.</p>
