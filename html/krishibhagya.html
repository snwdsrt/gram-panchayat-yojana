    <h1>Krishi Bhagya Scheme</h1>
    <p>The <strong>Krishi Bhagya Scheme</strong> is an initiative launched by the <strong>Government of Karnataka</strong> to improve agricultural sustainability, particularly in drought-prone areas. Introduced in <strong>2014-15</strong>, this scheme focuses on rainwater conservation, efficient irrigation, and modern farming practices to help farmers overcome the challenges of water scarcity.</p>

    <h2>Objectives of the Scheme</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Improve water availability for agriculture through rainwater harvesting.</li>
        <li>Ensure sustainable and profitable farming in dry-land areas.</li>
        <li>Promote modern irrigation techniques such as <strong>drip irrigation and sprinkler systems</strong>.</li>
        <li>Reduce dependency on monsoon rains by providing water storage solutions.</li>
        <li>Enhance farm productivity and encourage crop diversification.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Components of the Krishi Bhagya Scheme</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Farm Ponds</h3>
    <p>Farm ponds, also known as <strong>Krishi Hondas</strong>, are excavated structures used for rainwater collection. These ponds store water during the rainy season, ensuring a steady supply of water for irrigation during dry spells.</p>

    <h3>2. Polythene Lining</h3>
    <p>To minimize seepage and water loss, the government provides <strong>subsidized polythene sheets</strong> to line farm ponds, helping farmers retain more water for longer periods.</p>

    <h3>3. Fencing</h3>
    <p>To ensure safety and prevent water contamination, the scheme supports the installation of protective fencing around farm ponds.</p>

    <h3>4. Water Pumps and Micro-Irrigation</h3>

    <p>Farmers are provided with <strong>subsidized diesel or solar-powered pumps</strong> to extract water from farm ponds. Additionally, modern irrigation systems like <strong>drip irrigation and sprinklers</strong> are encouraged to maximize water efficiency.</p>

    <h3>5. Poly Houses and Shade Nets</h3>
    <p>To promote the cultivation of high-value crops, the scheme provides support for the construction of <strong>poly houses and shade nets</strong>, allowing farmers to grow vegetables, flowers, and fruits more efficiently.</p>

    <h2>Implementation and Achievements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>From <strong>2014-15 to 2020-21</strong>, the scheme helped construct <strong>289,827 farm ponds</strong>, significantly improving water availability in rural Karnataka.</li>
        <li>These farm ponds collectively hold <strong>1,472.31 lakh cubic meters</strong> of rainwater.</li>
        <li>Originally launched in <strong>four drought-prone zones</strong>, the scheme has expanded to cover all <strong>236 taluks across 31 districts</strong> of Karnataka.</li>
        <li>Currently, the government aims to build <strong>30,000 to 40,000 new farm ponds annually</strong> to improve water conservation efforts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Budget and Financial Assistance</h2>
    <p>In the <strong>2024-25 Karnataka Budget</strong>, the state government has allocated <strong>â‚¹200 crore</strong> for the reintroduction of the Krishi Bhagya Scheme. This funding aims to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Support farmers in constructing farm ponds.</li>
        <li>Encourage micro-irrigation systems like <strong>drip and sprinkler irrigation</strong>.</li>
        <li>Subsidize equipment for rainwater harvesting and storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2>
    <p>To avail benefits under the Krishi Bhagya Scheme, farmers must meet the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Applicants must be <strong>resident farmers of Karnataka</strong>.</li>
        <li>Farmers should own a minimum of <strong>one acre of land</strong>.</li>
        <li>Those who have already availed subsidies for pump sets or irrigation systems in the past <strong>three years</strong> are ineligible for those components but can still receive subsidies for farm ponds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Apply</h2>
    <p>Farmers can apply for the scheme through the following process:</p>
